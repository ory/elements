# Ory Elements

Ory Elements is a component library that makes building login, registration and
account pages for Ory a breeze:

- Reduces time to add complex auth flows to your customer experience, including
  multi-factor authentication and account recovery.
- Customizable, themeable, and replaceable components.
- Works with the React ecosystem (Next.js, plain React).
- Dynamically adapts the user interface to your Ory identity schema, sign-in and
  flow configuration.

Ory Elements has several packages:

- [`@ory/elements-react`](./packages/elements-react/README.md)
- [`@ory/nextjs`](./packages/nextjs/README.md)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you've used @ory/elements, @ory/elements-markup or @ory/elements-preact
> before, we recommend migrating to @ory/elements-react. The legacy code base is
> in https://github.com/ory/elements-legacy.

Ory Elements is a set of components that you can use to build your own login,
registration, settings, verification, recovery and consent user interface. To
just integrate authentication into your Next.js application and use the default
user interfaces, follow our
[guide for Auth.js](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/integrate-auth/auth-js).
